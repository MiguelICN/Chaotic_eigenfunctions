# Chaotic_eigenfunctions
Classification of chaotic eigenfunctions in the QKT and the coupled QKT's

Try to classify the chaotic eigenfunctions of the Floquet operator in order to apply (a modified) the factorization conjecture.
Are all eigenfunctions scarred? are the patterns visualized random or scarlets?
